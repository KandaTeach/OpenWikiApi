  "title": "Osu! Update!",
  "content": "Osu![a] (stylized as osu!) is a free-to-play rhythm game primarily developed, published, and created by Dean \"peppy\" Herbert. Inspired by iNiS' rhythm game Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, it was written in C# on the .NET Framework,[4] and was released for Microsoft Windows on 16 September 2007. The game has throughout the years been ported to macOS, Linux, Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nAside from Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, the game has been inspired by titles such as Taiko no Tatsujin, Beatmania IIDX,[5] EZ2DJ (EZ2CATCH), Elite Beat Agents, O2Jam, StepMania, and DJMax. All \"beatmaps\" in the game are community-made through the in-game map editor or through external tools. Four different game modes exist, offering various ways to play a beatmap. These modes can also be combined with optional modifiers, which can increase or decrease the difficulty.\r\n\r\nGameplay and features\r\nThere are four official game modes: \"osu!\" (called \"osu! standard\"), \"osu!taiko\", \"osu!catch\", and \"osu!mania\". With the addition of osu!lazer, players can now add custom gamemodes to the osu! client.[6][7] The original osu!standard mode remains the most popular to date and as of January 2023, the game has over 19.3 million monthly active users according to the game's global country leaderboards.[8]\r\n\r\n\"osu!standard\" takes direct inspiration from Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan games. In this gamemode, the player clicks circles to the beat of a song. This is the flagship gamemode featured on the osu! website.[9] \"osu!mania\" is a vertical scrolling rhythm game that mostly takes inspiration from Beatmania and Stepmania. The gamemode consists of notes that fall vertically in different lanes, with one key used to tap for each lane.[10] \"osu!taiko\" simulates playing on taiko and is based on Taiko no Tatsujin.[11] The final gamemode, osu!catch, is based on \"EZ2CATCH\", which was part of the EZ2DJ cabinet. In this gamemode, the player moves a catcher left or right in order to catch fruits falling from the top of the screen.[9][better source needed]\r\n\r\nEach mode offers a variety of \"beatmaps\", which are game levels that are played to songs of different lengths, ranging from \"TV size\" anime openings to \"marathons\" surpassing 7 minutes. In osu!standard, beatmaps consist of three items \u2013 hit circles, sliders, and spinners. The objective of the game is for the player to click on these items in time to the music. These items are collectively known as \"hit objects\" or \"circles\" and are arranged in different positions on the screen (except for the spinner) at different points of time during a song. Taiko beatmaps have drumbeats and spinners. Catch beatmaps have fruits and spinners (which are bananas), which are arranged in a horizontally falling manner. Mania beatmaps consist of keys (depicted as a small bar) and holds. The beatmap is then played with accompanying music, simulating a sense of rhythm as the player interacts with the objects to the beat of the music.[12][13] Each beatmap is accompanied by music and a background (which can be disabled). The game can be played using various peripherals: the most common setup is a graphics tablet or computer mouse to control cursor movement, paired with a keyboard[14][5] or a mini keyboard with only two keys, and only the keyboard for osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania beatmaps.\r\n\r\nThe game offers a buyable extension service called osu!supporter, which grants extra features to the user.[15] osu!supporter does not affect the ranking system or provide any in-game advantage. While osu!supporter itself is not a recurring service (meaning it is a one-off payment), it has a limited time validity ranging from 1 month to 2 years; however, multiple purchases of osu!supporter service time can be entitled to one user, allowing for longer uninterrupted service.",
